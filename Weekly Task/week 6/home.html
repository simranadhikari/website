       <p> Pashupatinath Temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Kathmandu. It is not known for certain when Pashupatinath Temple was built. But according to Nepal Mahatmaya and Himvatkhanda,the deity here gained great fame there as Pashupati. Pashupatinath Temple's existence is recorded as early as 400 CE.The ornamented pagoda houses the linga of Shiva. There are many legends describing how the temple of Aalok Pashupatinath came into existence here.
        One legend says that Shiva and Parvati took the form of antelopes in the forest on the Bagmati river's east bank. The gods later caught up with him and grabbed him by one of his horns, forcing him to resume his divine form. The broken horn was worshipped as a linga, but over time it was buried and lost. Centuries later a herdsman found one of his cows showering the earth with milk, and after digging at the site, he discovered the divine linga of Pashupatinath.
        According to Gopalraj Aalok Vhat, the temple was built by Prachanda Deva, a Licchavi king. 
        Another chronicle states that Pashupatinath Temple was in the form of Linga shaped Devalaya before Supuspa Deva constructed a five-storey temple of Pashupatinath in this place. As time passed, the temple needed to be repaired and renovated. It is known that this temple was reconstructed by a medieval king named Shivadeva (1099â€“1126 CE). It was renovated by Ananta Malla adding a roof to it.</p><br><br><br><br>

       <p> Perched on top of the Semgu Hill located in the outskirts to the west of the Kathmandu Valley, Swayambhu Temple temple is one of the most important eligious shrines in the city of Kathmandu. With a wite dome stupa and an array of shrines, this place draws people to it daily. Circumnavigating the temple in a clockwise direction is a common practice among the pilgrims since it is believed to wash away all the sins. The sanctum is one of the holiest sites among the Buddhists and Tibetans and is second only to the Lord Boudha for them.
        Also referred to as the Swayambhunath Temple, Swayambhunath Stupa, and the Swayambhu Maha Chaitya, this holy place of worship has been in existence for several centuries and has overlooked the greater portion of the Kathmandu Valley ever since. Owing to the several monkeys which have made the area around the complex their permanent abode, this temple has also earned the quirky nickname of the "Monkey Temple". Once you are inside the temple, make sure to climb the 365 steps to reach the top and take in the picturesque, panoramic view of the capital city of Kathmandu. </p><br><br><br><br>

    <p> Patan Durbar Square is situated at the centre of the city of Lalitpur in Nepal. It is one of the three Durbar Squares in the Kathmandu Valley, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. One of its attractions is the ancient royal palace where the Malla Kings of Lalitpur resided.
        The Durbar Square is a marvel of Newar architecture. The square floor is tiled with red bricks.There are many temples and statues in the area. The main temples are aligned opposite of the western face of the palace.The entrance of the temples faces east, towards the palace. There is also a bell situated in the alignment beside the main temples.The Square also holds old Newari residential houses. There are other temples and structures in and around Patan Durbar Square built by the Newa People. A center of both Hinduism and Buddhism, Patan Durbar Square has 136 "bahals" (courtyards) and 55 major temples. The history of Durbar Square is not clear. Although the Malla Kings of Lalitpur are credited with the establishment of the royal square, it is known that the site is an ancient crossroad. The Pradhanas, who settled around the site before the Mallas, have connections with the Durbar Square.Some chronicles hint that the Thakuri dynasty built a palace and made reforms to the locality, but there is little evidence of this. Scholars are certain that Patan was a prosperous city since ancient times.
        The Malla Kings made important changes to the square. Most of the current architecture is from the 1600s, constructed during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla and his son Srinivasa Sukriti. Some of the notable Malla Kings who improved the square include Purandarasimha, Sivasimha Malla and Yoganarendra Malla</p><br><br><br><br>
